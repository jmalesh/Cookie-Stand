    <h1>Welcome to Pat's Salmon Cookies</h1>
      <p class=into>
        Salmon Cookies combine two signature Seattle icons. They're cookies made into the shape of a salmon, and actually made with salmon (though the fish is ground up so fine that you can't even taste it!) that is the ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee on a gray Seattle morning.
